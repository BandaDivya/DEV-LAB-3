VIVA QUESTIONS

1) What do you mean by data type casting in the context of data analysis and data cleaning?
Data type casting means changing the data from one type to another (like text to numbers or numbers to dates).
In data cleaning, it helps make sure values are in the correct format so they can be analyzed and visualized properly.




2) When is it appropriate to drop missing values in data rather than imputing them in the context of data cleaning with pandas?
It’s better to drop missing values when they are very few and don’t affect the overall dataset, or when the missing data doesn’t carry important information.
If too many values are missing or the column is important, then imputing is a better choice.
["Impute" means filling in the missing values with some estimated value, like the mean, median, mode, or a predicted value, instead of leaving them blank or dropping them.]




3) What is pandas in python?
Pandas is a Python library that helps you store and work with data in tables (like Excel).
In Data Exploration and Visualization labs, it is used to clean, analyze, and prepare data for creating graphs and insights.




4) What are the steps involved in data transformation?
In Data Exploration and Visualization lab, data transformation involves:
Cleaning & Formatting – fixing missing values, removing errors, and converting data into a proper format.
Reshaping & Scaling – changing structure (like columns to rows), normalizing values, or creating new features for better analysis and visualization.




5) Can you explain why data cleansing is important?
Data cleansing is important because it removes errors, duplicates, and missing values, making the data accurate.
Clean data helps in better exploration and visualization, so the results are reliable and easy to understand.
